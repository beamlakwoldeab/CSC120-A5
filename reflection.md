- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
I see that association is not a term that is directly used in the code, but rather it is a way for the two classes to interact.
 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What worked for me was to revise all of the key concepts that we learnt about in class, like try-catch blocks, accessors and manipulators, arrays and arraylists, and then after feeling like you kind of remember how everything is, start the coding process. It was also helpful for me to write pseudocode and class diagrams.
